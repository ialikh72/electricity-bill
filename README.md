# Tiered Electricity Bill Calculator (C# Console App)

A simple C# console program that calculates the total electricity bill using tiered pricing.

## 📌 Pricing Rules

- First 50 units → $0.50 per unit  
- Next 50 units (51–100) → $0.75 per unit  
- Remaining units (101+) → $1.00 per unit  

## ▶️ How It Works

1. The user enters the number of electricity units used.
2. The program calculates the bill using tiered rates:
   - Units are split across pricing tiers.
3. The total bill is displayed.
